Hello,

my name is Robin. Welcome to my website.

My work revolves around a performative practice in the urban space that consists of perching myself in the trees of the city in order to establish a naive and spontaneous presence. This simple dispositive, this poetic image allows me to question the notions of subjectivity and productivity by developing a mode of urban sociability freed from any power and merchant relationship, outside the logics of production and competition.

The impulse that guides me is an act of revolt against the forces that dominate the mode of existence imposed by neoliberal capitalist ideology. In the heart of the city, I trace a line of active resistance which inscribes itself in a field of relationality distinct from the mechanics of power. Simply, it is a search for freedom.

Without label, indulged in contemplation, my character discovers through his encounters the richness, tensions, challenges and diversity of our cities and their inhabitants. I then derive from it stories, a mixture of observations and reflections inspired by my implantation in a localized social fabric, and my theoretical and philosophical research related to the deconstruction of my own subjectivity.

The themes that naturally emerge throughout my narrative journey include discrimination and gentrification, the notions of subjectification, assimilation, and sovereignty. Borrowing from many registers, my writings are accessible but without compromise in the face of the complexity of the world they depict. Through an analysis of the bourgeois epistemology, it is a rejection of the capitalist axiom that tends towards a radically internationalist and egalitarian line of thought.

This work develops in parallel with my interrogations on the ethics of creation, the legitimization of the artist and the production of knowledge. These issues emerge and intertwine in my writings, sketching out an incarnate philosophical discourse concerned with the political stakes of art in today's society.

My texts are available on this site in French and English. I may share them in paper format when I meet an audience, but they are never sold.

my readings and performances are adapted to the settings where they take place, technically and formally. This can range from an intimate reverie in the grass to an ambitious theatrical setup with sound, video and light work. In all cases, they are followed by a phase of conversation with the public, introduced by some principles of collective intelligence and ideally assisted by a facilitator.

It is also imperative that they are free, open to all and advertised in an inclusive and considered manner. My intervention on this last point, based on my experience in communication for the cultural sector, seeks to reach new audiences and to shake up the entre-soi that is characteristic of bourgeois artistic institutions. Without any misplaced pretensions, this intervention is done according to its contextual relevance and the time I can invest in it.

My performances are always non-remunerated, on the one hand, to allow the institutions that wish to welcome me to do so independently of their financial capacities, and on the other hand to develop a mode of operation where the free pursuit of my work is not determined by the political issues related to the financing of culture and the arts.

The financing of my practice is based on the patronage model. This principle allows me to keep my artistic research free from any production imperative and to choose my partners in accordance with my ethical and political values. I am aware of the paradoxes inherent in the choice of patronage as a method of financing. For lack of a better way, this is the model that provides me with the independence and security necessary for the pursuit of a fundamentally anti-capitalist approach.

Patronage is an incentive to support me in the long term, including for institutions that could not integrate me into their programme but wish to support my work. Non-monetary donations are also favoured, as well as the use of currencies independent of state and banking systems.
